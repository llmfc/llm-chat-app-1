        "what_it_is": "ü§î This is the main container component for the entire frontend application! It orchestrates the chat UI, manages the core application state (messages, selected model, loading status), and handles communication with the backend API.",
        "why_its_important": "‚ú® It ties everything together!\n*   **State Management:** Uses `useState` to hold the array of `messages`, the `selectedModel`, loading/error states (`isLoading`, `error`).\n*   **Layout:** Renders the `ModelSelector`, the chat message list (using `ChatMessage`), the `ChatInput`, and a 'New Chat' button.\n*   **API Interaction:** \n    *   Fetches available models (`/api/models`) on load using `useEffect`.\n    *   Sends user messages and conversation history to the backend (`/api/chat/stream`) when `handleSendMessage` is called.\n    *   Handles the Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream from the backend using `EventSource` to update the assistant's message in real-time. ‚ú®\n*   **Error Handling:** Catches errors during API calls or from the SSE stream and displays them.\n*   **Local Storage:** Uses `useEffect` hooks to persist the conversation `messages` and `selectedModel` to the browser's `localStorage`, so the chat state isn't lost on page refresh! üíæ\n*   **Scrolling:** Automatically scrolls the chat view to the bottom when new messages arrive.",
        "caveats": "‚ö†Ô∏è\n*   **SSE Connection Management:** Needs careful handling of the `EventSource` lifecycle (creating, closing, error handling). Ensure `eventSource.close()` is called properly, especially in `useEffect` cleanup, to prevent memory leaks or multiple connections.\n*   **Error Display:** The current error handling displays the error message within the chat area. A more prominent, perhaps temporary, notification might be better UX.\n*   **Large Chat History:** Storing very long conversations in `localStorage` can eventually hit browser limits (typically 5-10MB). For very heavy use, consider server-side storage or more advanced client-side storage.\n*   **State Complexity:** For much larger apps, managing state with only `useState` might become cumbersome (consider Zustand, Redux, etc.), but it's perfectly fine for this scale.",
        "improvements": "üöÄ\n*   **State Management Library:** If complexity grows, introduce Zustand or Redux Toolkit.\n*   **UI Framework/Library:** Integrate a component library like Material UI, Chakra UI, or Tailwind CSS (with utility components) for more sophisticated UI elements and styling consistency.\n*   **Optimistic UI:** Could display the user's message immediately *before* the API call returns for a snappier feel (though less critical with fast streaming).\n*   **Windowing/Virtualization:** For extremely long chats, use libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized` to
